<h3> Homework 1: Web Project Proposal </h3>
<p>
    My database experience consists SQL Basics and experience with MySQL Workbench. 
</p>
<p>    
    I proposed to create a web application that allows users, the artists, to upload their music on the platform so listeners can hear them. 
</p>
<p>
    I struggled a bit finding the topic for my application, but other than that the homework was OK.

<h3>Homework 2: Database</h3>
<p>
    In this homework, I learned how to create tables in a relational database,  
    populate these tables, and select data from these tables. 
</p>
<p>
    I found the SELECT statements was a bit tricky because I have to find the exact statement to call a specific chunk of data.

<h3>Homework 3: Home Page</h3>
<p>
    My web development/design experience is 3 months of internship on Natural Language Processing which taught me some web design and development. 
</p>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to create a home page that uses JavaScript to make 
    AJAX calls to read HTML partial files that get injected into the content area  
    (to achieve HTML code reuse). 
    I also learn some of the basics on HTML and CSS and how to publish a website onto the internet. The hardest part of this HW was following instructions, because there are so many..
</p>

<h3>Homework 4: Display Data</h3>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to write Web APIs using JSP pages (server side technology) to 
    output database data in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation). I also learned how to write JavaScript 
    code to (1) convert the JSON to a JavaScript object and (2) build an HTML table to hold the 
    data from the JavaScript object.  
</p>
<p>
    I create a whole bunch of java classes and jsp pages to call the results and combine database fields to create a 
    beautiful HTML table. The SQL Statement has to be exact in order to get the right data set.
    From this homework I learned how to display data from MySQL Database to the client server and all the basics around it. I found the 
    most challenging aspect of the homework is the code studying part. The sample code are a lot, some of them are even redundant 
    so I have to read them all through and choose the right piece of code to modify and use.

<h3>Homework 5: Log On</h3>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to write Log On, Log Off, and Profile API where I asks the user to log in before showing his or her profile.
    
</p>
<p>
    The hardest part of this assignment for me is how to connect the function in account.js to the API (.jsp). I also spent a lot of time to read the code to
    understand how it works. I got stuck many times, but luckily I still figured it out. However, I encounter problems when I try to use ajax with callback
    function to display the profile data. I ended up having to naturally print User Profile as a JSON object from the API (out.print). I want to make 
    it display in JavaScript.
</p>

<h3>Tutorial</h3>
<p>
    For this assignment, we have to select a web topic and implement a few web widgets to build our simple framework.
    
</p>

<p>
    So far I am still confused about this project. I looked through the HowTo W3School to look for ideas but honestly most of the widgets there don't have much impact
    over my web app, so the experience is pretty much the same. As a result, the functionalities for my framework appears to be the same, not very useful in enhancing
    my web page. I have no idea what specifically Sally looks for for this project. I also see no reason to have a demo.html file because I suppose all the consumers 
    need is to include a script for the JS file, then call up the functions with appropriate arguments for it. Essentially it totally depends on the consumer of how
    and where they want to use it in their stuff. Pretty pointless.

<h3>Homework 6a&b: Insert</h3>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to implement insert function to my webpage. To do this, I create an UI that holds all the values the user 
    typed in. Then I need to implement a JS file that made an AJAX call to an insert API, which I also have to implement. There are a lot of stuff, and I
    learned a lot.
    
</p>

<p>
    I guess the most valuable thing I got out from this homework is how to use debugging effectively, because I haven't been able to do so until this homework.
    It took me some quite chalenging time getting used to it, but once I got the flow I was able to find bugs and fix it easily. The most challenging thing to
    me I guess is having to read a lot of tidious code.
</p>

<h3>Homework 7: Delete</h3>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to implement delete function to my webpage. To do this, I add a delete button next to each record in the data table.
    When this button is clicked, it makes an AJAX call to a delete API which I also implement. The API also refers to Java Source code to do the deletion.
    
</p>

<p>
    I have no problem at all implementing Delete func for Web User Table and Artist table. However, this is not the case for the Song table. The issue is
    I did not display song_id in the Song table. This happened a long time ago in HW 4 or 5 as I read the manual and it says song_id should not be displayed.
    I tried my best revising and adding song_id to Song StringData, List Table, etc... but somehow it still would not work. I was able to have it not throw
    any uncaught error, but when I attempt to delete a record, the alert message keeps telling me it did not delete the record, or sometimes it throws a
    restraint exception. What confuses me even more is out of all my attempts there is actually ONE SINGLE RECORD that I was able to delete, and that is it.
    I cannot be certain where the errors come from. This is very weird, I will need TA to look into this issue.
</p>


<h3>Homework 8a: Update User & Assoc</h3>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to implement update function in my user and my "other" table. To do this, I add a update button next to each record in the data table.
    When this button is clicked, it projects an Update UI that shows all the record's info in text boxes. Users can modify these fields, and when they click on the
    update & save button, it makes an AJAX call to a update API, which refers to Java Source code to process the update (creating SQL, injecting it through, etc..)
    
</p>

<p>
    This homework took me a bit of time than expected because I was not able to get the update in the playlist table (or "other" table) to work. Fortunately I had Sally help me on
    this problem, and I figured that in the js file I did not add an Id field onto the json object which will then be on the URL parameter to call the API. But now 
    it works fine now as the rest of the other functions.
</p>
